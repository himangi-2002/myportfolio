Welcome to my personal portfolio website built with React.js!

To explore my portfolio, follow these steps:

1. **Download and unzip the provided file.**
2. **Open the folder in a code editor** (VS Code is recommended).
3. In the terminal, run:
   
   npm start
  

   This command launches the app in development mode. You can then view the portfolio by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The main code for the project is located in the `src` folder, specifically within `App.js` and the `Components` folder, which contains the JSX and CSS files for each page. 

All assets, such as images, are in the `src/assets` folder.

Enjoy browsing through my portfolio!
